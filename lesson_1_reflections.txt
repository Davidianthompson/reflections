The previous version of the file worked.
The bug must have been a change.
Filtering the changes allowed quick identification of points where bug could have been introduced.

Accessing older versions allows quick reversion to previous versions, track changes and no need to comment out code you might need later.

Manual commits, pros:
- logical break points
- add comments
- won't commit anything you don't want to
cons:
- might forget

Git can save mulitple files per commit since several files may be involved in a single logical change.  
Google docs is different because the docs are less interrelated and saves are more frequent.

Git log and diff can be used to see what changes have been made to a repository and to compare 2 versions.

Version control allows you to make changes confidently, knowing that you can revert to a previous working version at any time.

Can use git for version control for pet projects.
