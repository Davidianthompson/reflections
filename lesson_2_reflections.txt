Q. What happens when you initialise a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

Initialising a repository creates a .git folder containing various book-keeping files.
This distinguishes it from an untracked folder and enables the git functionalities.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository?  What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows selection of which changes made in working directory to migrate into repository.
Useful to add completed changes and not add uncompleted changes, or to break change up into chunks.

Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If you have multiple changes you can break them into chunks by migrating them to the staging area individually.

Q. What are some situations in which branches would be helpful in keeping your history organised?  How would branches help?

If you are working on several changes in parallel, or multiple people working in parallel, or testing an experimental feature.

Q. How do the diagrams help you visualise the branch structure?

Um... because they are a visualisation of the branch structure?
