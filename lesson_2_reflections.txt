Q. What happens when you initialise a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

Initialising a repository creates a .git folder containing various book-keeping files.
This distinguishes it from an untracked folder and enables the git functionalities.

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository?  What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows selection of which changes made in working directory to migrate into repository.
Useful to add completed changes and not add uncompleted changes, or to break change up into chunks.
