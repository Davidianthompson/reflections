Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with others, when working from multiple worksites, or as a backup.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Might not be ready to share with public yet.
